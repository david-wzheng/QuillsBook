## Summary
Our adventurers come to in a mysterious room, with a small porthole overlooking a coastal city. [[Revenant]] and [[Taragon]] hit it off quickly, while [[Entropy]], [[Quill]], and [[Danzu]] are more cautious. [[Haiden]], less cautious and more angry, and understandably mistrustful, tries the door but finds it locked. A bed also happens to find itself flung across the room... The uncertain conditions of our arrival and a peculiar symbol on the back of our hands only further complicates matters. After some cursory introductions (or lack thereof), a maid discovers that the party is awake, prompting the appearance of [[Movus]], Captain of the King's guard, and ~~Grima Wormtongue~~  [[Letholvus McKinnon]], King's Right Hand, who bring us before [[King Tark]]. Aside from [[Revenant|Revenant's]] "answers", not much else can be discovered aside from the fact that we currently grace [[King Tark| King Tark's]] court in the city of [[Tarton]], on the Island of [[Breica]]. A map is provided by [[Movus]] with suprisingly little else except "There's goblins here" and a threat of the undead (and ~~Mr.~~ General Evil??). A brief tour around town sees a visit to the eccentric cartographer [[Mapicus]], who provides the key to the map and more intrigue on the mysterious symbol, and a stop at [[Talehat]]'s smithery, where [[Quill]] wins a free knife with a stylish performance. After returning to the barracks at [[King Tark]]'s keep for a bit of noon grub (swallowed whole because "I like food...!") the party heads out to knock some gobbies. After a little overnight stop and some more travelling the [[Goblin Cave|cave]] is entered and [[Danzu]] takes some goblin heads in quick but quiet succession. The rest of the party finds varying degrees of success, as well as some close calls, before agreeing to a quick respite from the goblin slaughter.
