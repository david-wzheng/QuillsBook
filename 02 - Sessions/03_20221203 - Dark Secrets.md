	- Both enter the empty tavern and order
		- [[Haiden]] - Gut-shaker (fermented goat milk and shrooms) 
		- [[Danzu]] - The hairy wizard (various shades of brown itchy sensation)
	- this leads to [[Haiden]] assaulting the barkeep with his head, eventually hexing and killing him (Bateman moment??)
	- and [[Danzu]] getting wasted 
	- [[Entropy]] barges in, nearly gets shot by a drunk [[Danzu]] suspicious of the whole situation but [[Haiden]] manages to hide that he has killed the barkeep
- [[Haiden]] casts disguise-self and pretends to be the innkeeper, charging the party for their stay (this includes a hammer from [[Revenant]])
- Hijinks ensue but the party gets through the night
### Day 8
